# Sheryians Coding School Web Page Clone 🚀

This is a web page clone project that I have made using HTML and Tailwind CSS. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of classes and components for styling web elements. I have used the Tailwind CSS CDN temporarily to post the project on GitHub, but I have also set up the necessary files and packages for using Tailwind CSS locally in my VS Code editor.

## Features ✨

- A responsive header with a logo and a navigation menu
- A hero section with a catchy headline, a subheading, and a call-to-action button
- A background image that covers half of the screen
- A simple and clean design with a green and white color scheme

## How I made it 🛠️

I have used the following steps to set up and use Tailwind CSS:

- I have installed Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, and Autoprefixer as development dependencies using the command `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`.
- I have initialized Tailwind CSS using the command `npx tailwindcss init`, which created a `tailwind.config.js` file in my project root.
- I have configured the `tailwind.config.js` file to specify the content files that Tailwind CSS should scan for class names, and the theme and plugins options that Tailwind CSS should use.
- I have created a `postcss.config.js` file in my project root, and added Tailwind CSS and Autoprefixer as plugins.
- I have created a `style.css` file in my project root, and added the `@tailwind` directives to inject the base, components, and utilities styles of Tailwind CSS.
- I have run the command `npm run dev` to compile my `style.css` file into a `build.css` file that contains the final CSS code for my web page.
- I have linked the `build.css` file in my HTML file using the `<link>` tag, and used the Tailwind CSS classes and components to style my web elements.

## Future Plans 🚧

- I will make the web page responsive for different screen sizes and devices using the Tailwind CSS breakpoints and responsive modifiers.
- I will add more sections and features to the web page, such as testimonials, pricing, contact, and footer.
- I will improve the accessibility and performance of the web page using the best practices and tools.

## Feedback 🙏

I have made this project to show my Tailwind CSS skills and to learn more about web development. I would appreciate any feedback or suggestions on how to improve my project. . Thank you for your time and attention. 😊
